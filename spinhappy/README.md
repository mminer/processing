This sketch — let's title it "Spin Happy" — allows the user to control the speed of the music and shapes, which work in tandem to produce a pleasing visualization. The faster the music, the happier the visualization becomes. Some basic animation techniques are used as well as more involved mathematics to attain circular movement of the sketch's elements. The result is my effort to better understand the math to move shapes along a given path yet still give control to the user. It was created as an assignment for [Coursera's Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps](https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalmedia) course and uses an audio library (maxim.js) provided by them.
