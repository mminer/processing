Type Snipe is a game to help beginning typists hone their skills, or to challenge those who have mastered the keyboard. Letters rain from the sky, and it's up to you to destroy them before they crash to the ground. Gameplay is simple â€” just type the appropriate letter to make it disappear. The game increases in difficultly as time progresses. Even those boasting the most fearsome WPM will be hard pressed to get a triple digit score.
